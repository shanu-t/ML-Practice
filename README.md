"I started practicing Machine Learning because I am very interested in how machines can learn from data and make predictions. 
 I wanted to develop skills that are highly demanded in the tech industry."
 Topic
 Supervised Learning:- "I practiced classification and regression problems, where the model learns from labeled data."
 Unsupervised Learning:-"I practiced clustering techniques like K-Means, where the model finds patterns without labeled data."
 Model Evaluation:-"I learned how to measure model accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices."
 Data Preprocessing:-"I practiced cleaning data, handling missing values, encoding categorical data, feature scaling, and feature selection."
 Model Training:-"I trained models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression."
 Using Libraries:-"I worked with libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn."

 **I learned how important data cleaning and feature engineering are for building a good model**
 **I understood the difference between underfitting and overfitting, and how to balance bias-variance**

 One challenge I encountered was overfitting due to the limited size of the dataset. To address this, I used data augmentation and explored few-shot learning techniques.

**I plan to refine the model further by incorporating more diverse data or experimenting with different architectures.
  I am also interested in deploying the model into a real-world application, such as an assistive tool for clinicians**
